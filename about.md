KKYU is an interdisciplinary seminar community dedicated to sharing diverse perspectives across fields and sparking creative collaboration.
Our goal is to make advanced research and scientific ideas accessible and engaging even to non-specialists, building a space where anyone can feel inspired to explore new topics.
Through open presentations and lively discussions, we encourage participants from various backgrounds to connect, exchange insights, and discover new ways of thinking together.

Join us as we bridge disciplines and create a platform where fields meet, ideas cross-pollinate, and innovation begins.
